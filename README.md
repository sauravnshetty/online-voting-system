# online-voting-system
A web app to create and participate in elections

## Introduction
This is a simple web application called VoteHub which provides an online platform to create custom elections and simplify the voting procedure. The application was developed using Java Spring Framework, specifically Java Spring boot.

## Deployment
Deployment of this app was done using the heroku cloud platform. Process is pretty simple as heroku can automatically detect Spring boot apps.

### Connecting to database
Heroku allows you to create addons for database. I used a postgresql database, heroku provides an addon for it free of cost. It also connects the database automatically to your app.
